# Habitable Zone plugin for [EDMC](https://github.com/EDCD/EDMarketConnector/wiki)

This plugin helps explorers find high-value planets. It displays the "habitable-zone" (i.e. the range of distances in which you might find an Earth-Like World) when you scan the primary star in a system with a [Detailed Surface Scanner](http://elite-dangerous.wikia.com/wiki/Detailed_Surface_Scanner).

Optionally, you can choose to display the ranges in which you might find other high-value planets - Metal-Rich, Water and/or Ammonia Worlds.

Optionally, you can choose to display the high-value planets known to [Elite Dangerous Star Map](https://www.edsm.net/).
